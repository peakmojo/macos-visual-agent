# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a minimal repository containing:
- A basic README.md file with the project name "Visual Agent"
- An SQLite database file (openmemory.sqlite) which appears to be untracked in git

## Architecture

The repository is currently in a very early stage with minimal structure. The main components are:
- **openmemory.sqlite**: A SQLite database file that is not tracked by git (likely contains local data)

## Development

Since this repository contains minimal code and no build system configuration files (no package.json, requirements.txt, Makefile, etc.), there are currently no specific build, test, or development commands available.

The repository appears to be a starting point for a project called "Visual Agent" that may involve SQLite database operations.
