# Visual Agent - macOS Desktop App

A macOS desktop overlay app that monitors screen activity and allows team members to see each other's work status in real-time.

## Features

- **Overlay Interface**: Minimal, always-on-top interface that doesn't interfere with work
- **Screen Monitoring**: Captures screenshots, mouse movements, and keystrokes (with permissions)
- **Buddy System**: Shows team members and their current status (watching, taking a break, disabled)
- **Real-time Status**: Visual indicators for each team member's activity
- **Database Persistence**: SQLite database for storing buddy information and activity logs
- **Privacy Controls**: Individual buddies can be disabled from monitoring

## Requirements

- macOS 13.0 or later
- Xcode 14.0 or later (for building)
- Screen Recording permission
- Accessibility permission (for keystroke monitoring)

To contribute or modify the app:

1. Open `VisualAgent.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Make your changes
3. Test thoroughly, especially permission handling
4. Build and run using Xcode or the build script

## Permissions Explained
